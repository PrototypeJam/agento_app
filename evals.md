# Collecting Traces

Given the current Streamlit implentation of Agento uses the OpenAI AI Agets SDK there are some good options for collecting traces including potentially for spans of tasks and full workflows.

# INQUIRY 


# Perplexity

Based on the search results, here are the answers to your three questions about OpenAI traces:

## **a) Getting and Saving Local Copies of Traces**

Yes, you can capture traces locally when using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** through custom trace processors. The Agents SDK provides built-in tracing capabilities with options to add custom processors[12]:

- **`add_trace_processor()`** - Lets you add an additional trace processor that receives traces and spans as they are ready, allowing your own processing in addition to sending traces to OpenAI's backend
- **`set_trace_processors()`** - Lets you replace the default processors entirely with your own trace processors

The SDK collects comprehensive trace data including "LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, guardrails, and even custom events that occur"[12].

## **b) Downloading Traces via API Later**

The search results do not show evidence of a direct API to download or access saved traces from the OpenAI dashboard after they've been stored. However, there are third-party integrations available:

- **Langfuse integration** - You can link OpenAI Agents SDK traces to Langfuse for external monitoring and evaluation[8]
- **MLflow integration** - MLflow provides automatic tracing capability for OpenAI Agents SDK by enabling `mlflow.openai.autolog()`[13]

These integrations allow you to capture and store traces in external systems where you have full API access.

## **c) Does Using the Agents SDK Matter?**

**Yes, it makes a significant difference.** The OpenAI Agents SDK has much more robust built-in tracing compared to the standard Responses API:

- **Built-in tracing by default** - "Tracing is enabled by default" with comprehensive event collection[12]
- **Advanced trace management** - Includes traces, spans, workflow names, trace IDs, and metadata[12]
- **Custom processor support** - Allows you to intercept and process traces locally[12]
- **Integration ecosystem** - Works with external tracing systems like Langfuse and MLflow[8][13]

To set up tracing with the Agents SDK, you need to configure it properly:

```python
from agents import set_tracing_export_api_key, trace

set_tracing_export_api_key(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

with trace("your_trace_id"):
    # Your agent execution code
```

## **Recommendation**

For your analytics needs, the best approach would be to:

1. **Use the Agents SDK** instead of just the Responses API for enhanced tracing capabilities
2. **Implement custom trace processors** to capture traces locally in real-time
3. **Consider integrating with Langfuse or MLflow** for comprehensive trace management and analytics

This approach gives you immediate access to trace data without relying on potential future API endpoints for downloading traces from the OpenAI dashboard.

# ChatGPT o3 with Search

Below is a consolidated guide to what you *can* and *cannot* do with OpenAI “traces” today, plus the most practical ways to keep a complete local copy for analytics.

---

## Key points in one paragraph

*The traces you see in the OpenAI dashboard are written by an internal **Tracing API** that only supports **ingest** (POST `/v1/traces/ingest`). There is **no public “read” endpoint or bulk-export button** yet, so you cannot pull those historical records later. The only reliable way to get every trace is to export it yourself at runtime. The recommended pattern is to instrument your code with **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** or let the **OpenAI Agents SDK** do it for you, then attach an additional OTel exporter that writes the spans (traces) to your own database, S3, data-lake, APM-tool, or even a local JSON file. Using the Agents SDK makes this trivial (tracing is on by default), but even plain `openai` calls can be wrapped with the community OpenInference instrumentation. In short: (a) capture while you run, (b) there is no official download-later route (yet), and (c) the Agents SDK only changes how *easy* it is to capture—it does not unlock any extra export capability.*

---

## 1.  What the OpenAI Tracing service actually does

| Aspect          | Current status                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Endpoint**    | `POST /v1/traces/ingest` (internal) ([OpenAI Community][1])                                    |
| **Read / list** | Not public; dashboard UI only ([OpenAI Platform][2])                                           |
| **Retention**   | 30 days for free tier; 90 days for enterprise (per OpenAI console tooltip) ([OpenAI][3])       |
| **Format**      | OTLP/JSON spans, conforming to OpenTelemetry conventions ([OpenAI GitHub][4], [baeke.info][5]) |

Because there is no “GET /v1/traces” route, analytics workflows must **store a second copy elsewhere**.  This is exactly what the Agents SDK and most third-party observability stacks make possible.

---

## 2.  Capturing traces *during* every run

### 2.1 Using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** (Python)

```python
from agents import Agent, set_tracing_export_api_key, add_trace_processor
from agents.tracing.processors import OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor

# Point a second exporter at your own collector or S3-compatible endpoint
add_trace_processor(
    OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor(
        endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"   # Jaeger, Tempo, etc.
    )
)

set_tracing_export_api_key(os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])   # still needed for UI view

# build / run your agent as usual …
```

*Why this works*

* The Agents SDK emits spans for every LLM call, tool call, guard-rail and custom event. ([OpenAI GitHub][6])
* `OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor` is documented in the SDK reference and can be pointed at any OTel backend. ([OpenAI GitHub][4])
* You can disable or replace the default OpenAI exporter so **no data ever leaves your VPC** if you wish. `set_tracing_disabled(True)` does exactly that. ([OpenAI GitHub][7])

### 2.2 Instrumenting **plain OpenAI SDK** code

If you are not on the Agents SDK yet, add automatic instrumentation:

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai opentelemetry-sdk
```

```python
from openinference.instrumentation.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(
    BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://tempo:4318/v1/traces"))
)
OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()   # <-- wraps openai.ChatCompletion, etc.
```

*Community packages turn raw SDK calls into proper OTLP spans* ([docs.arize.com][8], [docs.arize.com][9]).

### 2.3 Ready-made back-ends

Instead of running raw Jaeger or Tempo, you can plug straight into:

* **Arize Phoenix** (open-source UI, CSV export). ([Arize AI][10])
* **LangSmith** (flat trace CSV/JSON export APIs). ([LangSmith][11])
* **Braintrust**, **Keywords AI**, **AgentOps**, **Logfire**, etc.—all ship an “OpenAI Agents SDK” endpoint you can drop in as an exporter. ([Braintrust][12], [docs.keywordsai.co][13])

Each of these platforms gives you REST or SQL-like access to the stored spans so you can run ad-hoc analytics later.

---

## 3.  Trying to “download later” from the OpenAI dashboard

| Question                       | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Is there an export button?** | Not today (June 2025). The tracing UI only offers per-run JSON copy. ([OpenAI Platform][2])                                                                                                                        |
| **Is there a public API?**     | No documented `GET /traces` or `GET /runs/:id/trace` endpoint. Only `POST /traces/ingest` is referenced in SDK docs. ([OpenAI Community][1], [OpenAI GitHub][4])                                                   |
| **Enterprise workaround?**     | Some enterprise contracts allow periodic **GDPR/DSR exports** via support ticket, but format and SLA are not documented publicly. (Mentioned in contract FAQ pop-up—not in public docs, so you cannot rely on it.) |

**Therefore:** If you need 100 % coverage for analytics, plan to store traces yourself when the call happens.

---

## 4.  Does using the Agents SDK change any of this?

| Topic                                              | Effect                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capture effort**                                 | *Much lower.* Tracing is on by default; one line adds a custom exporter. ([OpenAI GitHub][6], [OpenAI GitHub][4]) |
| **Ability to fetch historic OpenAI-hosted traces** | *No change.* The SDK still posts to `…/traces/ingest`; there is no corresponding “list” API.                      |
| **Vendor lock-in**                                 | *Optional.* You can disable the built-in exporter or run offline. ([OpenAI GitHub][14])                           |

---

## 5.  Practical reference architecture

```text
┌───────── App / Agent ───────────┐
│  OpenAI or Agents SDK           │
│  (OTel spans generated)         │
└──────────────┬──────────────────┘
               │  OTLP/HTTP
               ▼
┌────── OTel Collector ──────┐
│  (batch, retry, scrub PII) │
└──────┬───────────────┬─────┘
       ▼               ▼
  S3 / Data-lake   Jaeger / Tempo
       ▼               ▼
 Athena / Spark   Grafana, SQL, etc.
```

This keeps a **local ground-truth copy** while still letting you forward to the OpenAI dashboard if you find it useful for debugging.

---

## 6.  Minimal checklist for production

1. **Add an OTel exporter** (or OpenInference) before you ship.
2. **Verify span counts** locally—they should match the number of model/tool calls you expect.
3. **Store raw OTLP** (binary or JSON) in object storage so you can replay later.
4. **Scrub** prompt/response bodies if they contain sensitive data; OTel attribute filters work well.
5. **Disable the default OpenAI exporter** if policy requires zero third-party logging.

### Bottom line

*Until OpenAI ships a public “download traces” API, the only bullet-proof strategy is to **export every span yourself at runtime**. The Agents SDK makes that one-line easy, and OpenTelemetry/OpenInference cover the rest of the stack.*

# Grok3 with Search

To address your query about obtaining and analyzing traces from the OpenAI Responses API, including considerations for the OpenAI Agents SDK, I’ll provide detailed answers for each part (a, b, and c) based on the most relevant and up-to-date information available. The goal is to help you capture traces locally during app execution, access saved traces from the OpenAI Dashboard via an API or download, and clarify any differences when using the OpenAI Agents SDK. All information is tailored to the current version of the OpenAI Responses API as of June 1, 2025\.

**a) Getting and Saving a Local Copy of Traces When Running the App**

Yes, it is possible to capture and save a local copy of traces when your application runs using the OpenAI Responses API. The OpenAI Agents SDK, which integrates with the Responses API, provides built-in tracing capabilities that can be customized to store traces locally for analytics. Here’s how you can achieve this:

* **Use the OpenAI Agents SDK’s Tracing Functionality**:  
  * The OpenAI Agents SDK includes automatic tracing that logs agent execution details, such as model calls, tool usage, and handoffs. By default, these traces are sent to the OpenAI backend and visible in the OpenAI Dashboard. However, you can configure the SDK to capture traces locally by adding a custom trace processor.  
  * **Steps to Implement**:  
    * Install the OpenAI Agents SDK if not already installed:  
    * bash

```shell
pip install openai-agents
```

    * Configure a custom trace processor to save traces locally. The SDK allows you to add a TraceProcessor to process traces and spans as they are generated. You can write a processor to save traces to a local file (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a database).  
    * Example code to save traces locally:  
    * python

```py
from agents import Agent, Runner, TraceProcessor, trace
import json
import os

class LocalTraceProcessor(TraceProcessor):
    def process_trace(self, trace):
        # Save trace to a local JSON file
        with open('traces.json', 'a') as f:
            json.dump(trace.to_dict(), f, indent=2)
            f.write('\n')  # Add newline for readability

    def process_span(self, span):
        # Optionally process individual spans
        pass

# Initialize the TraceProvider with the custom processor
from agents import set_global_trace_provider, TraceProvider
trace_provider = TraceProvider()
trace_provider.add_trace_processor(LocalTraceProcessor())
set_global_trace_provider(trace_provider)

# Define and run an agent
agent = Agent(name="ExampleAgent", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
with trace("ExampleWorkflow"):
    result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Hello, world!")
    print(result.final_output)
```

    * In this example, the LocalTraceProcessor saves each trace as a JSON object to a file named traces.json. You can modify the processor to store traces in a database or another format suitable for your analytics needs.  
* **Integrate with an Observability Platform**:  
  * You can use an observability platform like **Langfuse** to capture traces locally or in a structured format for analytics. Langfuse integrates with the OpenAI Agents SDK via OpenTelemetry instrumentation, allowing you to save traces locally or send them to a custom backend.  
  * **Steps**:  
    * Install required packages:  
    * bash

```shell
pip install openai-agents pydantic-ai[logfire] langfuse
```

    * Configure Langfuse to save traces locally or to a custom endpoint. For local storage, you can use the OpenTelemetry exporter to write traces to a file or database.  
    * Example configuration:  
    * python

```py
import os
import logfire
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Configure Langfuse and OpenTelemetry
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "http://localhost:3000"  # Local Langfuse instance
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:3000/api/public/otel"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."

# Instrument OpenAI Agents SDK
logfire.configure(service_name='my_app', send_to_logfire=False)
logfire.instrument_openai_agents()

# Run an agent
agent = Agent(name="ExampleAgent", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "What's the weather today?")
print(result.final_output)
```

    * Langfuse captures traces (including spans for model calls, tool usage, etc.) and allows you to export them for analytics. You can run a local Langfuse instance (e.g., via Docker) to store traces locally without sending them to a remote server.  
* **Analytics on Local Traces**:  
  * Once traces are saved locally (e.g., as JSON files), you can use Python libraries like pandas or sqlite3 to analyze them. For example, you can parse the JSON traces to extract metrics like latency, token usage, or tool calls.  
  * Example analysis:  
  * python

```py
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load traces from file
traces = []
with open('traces.json', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        traces.append(json.loads(line))

# Convert to DataFrame for analysis
df = pd.DataFrame(traces)
print(df[['workflow_name', 'trace_id', 'start_time', 'end_time']])
# Perform analytics, e.g., average latency, tool usage frequency
```

  * This approach allows you to perform custom analytics, such as tracking the frequency of specific tools, measuring workflow performance, or identifying errors.

**b) Downloading or Accessing Saved Traces from the OpenAI Dashboard via API**

Currently, there is no direct OpenAI API endpoint specifically for downloading or accessing traces stored in the OpenAI Dashboard. The OpenAI Dashboard’s Trace Viewer displays traces for agent runs, but OpenAI’s documentation does not provide a public API for retrieving these traces programmatically. However, there are workarounds and alternative approaches to access or replicate this data:

* **Use Local Tracing to Avoid Reliance on the Dashboard**:  
  * As described in part (a), capturing traces locally during app execution is the most reliable way to obtain trace data for analytics. By using a custom TraceProcessor or an observability platform like Langfuse, you can store all trace data locally or in a custom backend, eliminating the need to download from the OpenAI Dashboard.  
* **Manual Export from the OpenAI Dashboard**:  
  * The OpenAI Dashboard’s Trace Viewer allows you to view traces, but there is no documented feature for bulk downloading traces as of June 1, 2025\. You may be able to manually export individual traces by inspecting the dashboard’s network requests (e.g., using browser developer tools) to capture the JSON data sent from OpenAI’s servers. However, this is not scalable for analytics purposes and is not recommended for production use.  
  * **Note**: Manual export is time-consuming and error-prone. It’s better to focus on local capture as described in part (a).  
* **Contact OpenAI Support for Enterprise Solutions**:  
  * For enterprise users or those with a paid OpenAI plan, you can contact OpenAI support to inquire about API access to dashboard traces or custom export options. OpenAI may offer bespoke solutions for high-volume users, but this is not publicly documented.  
* **Alternative: Use Third-Party Observability Tools**:  
  * Tools like Langfuse or other OpenTelemetry-compatible platforms (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) can capture traces and provide APIs for accessing them later. By integrating Langfuse as shown in part (a), you can use its API to retrieve traces programmatically:  
    * **Langfuse API Example**:  
    * python

```py
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse(
    public_key="pk-lf-...",
    secret_key="sk-lf-...",
    host="http://localhost:3000"
)
traces = langfuse.get_traces()
for trace in traces:
    print(trace)
```

    * This approach allows you to query traces stored in a local or hosted Langfuse instance, providing a scalable alternative to accessing OpenAI Dashboard traces.  
* **Limitations**:  
  * OpenAI’s documentation does not mention a public API for retrieving traces from the dashboard. If you rely on dashboard traces, you may be limited to manual inspection or third-party tools until OpenAI releases such an API.  
  * For organizations with a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy, tracing is disabled entirely, so no traces will be available in the dashboard or via API. Ensure your OpenAI account is not configured with ZDR if you need traces.

**c) Does It Matter or Change Anything If the App Uses the OpenAI Agents SDK?**

Yes, using the OpenAI Agents SDK does matter and provides specific advantages for handling traces, especially since it is designed to work seamlessly with the Responses API. Here’s how it impacts your ability to capture and analyze traces:

* **Built-In Tracing with the Agents SDK**:  
  * The OpenAI Agents SDK includes built-in tracing that automatically generates traces for agent runs, including details about model calls, tool usage, handoffs, and guardrails. These traces are sent to the OpenAI backend by default and appear in the OpenAI Dashboard’s Trace Viewer. This is a key feature of the SDK, making it easier to monitor and debug agent workflows compared to using the Responses API alone.  
  * When using the Agents SDK, you can leverage its TraceProvider and TraceProcessor to customize how traces are handled, as shown in part (a). This is not available if you use the Responses API directly without the SDK.  
* **Custom Trace Processing**:  
  * The Agents SDK allows you to add custom trace processors to capture traces locally or send them to external systems (e.g., Langfuse, a database, or a file). This is particularly useful for analytics, as you can structure traces in a format suitable for your needs. Without the SDK, you would need to implement custom logging for Responses API calls, which is less straightforward.  
* **Multi-Agent Workflows**:  
  * If your app uses the Agents SDK to orchestrate multi-agent workflows (e.g., with handoffs between agents), traces will include additional context, such as which agent handled a task, the handoff logic, and tool interactions. This richer trace data is valuable for analytics, as it provides insights into complex workflows. The Responses API alone does not provide this level of orchestration or trace detail.  
* **Impact on Trace Access**:  
  * The Agents SDK does not change the lack of a public API for retrieving traces from the OpenAI Dashboard. Whether you use the SDK or the Responses API directly, you cannot programmatically access dashboard traces without a custom solution (e.g., local capture or third-party tools). However, the SDK’s tracing infrastructure makes it easier to capture traces locally during execution, reducing reliance on the dashboard.  
* **Zero Data Retention (ZDR) Considerations**:  
  * If your OpenAI account is configured with a ZDR policy, tracing is disabled for both the Responses API and the Agents SDK. This means no traces will be sent to the OpenAI Dashboard or available for local capture unless you explicitly configure a custom trace processor to bypass this restriction (e.g., by saving traces before they are sent to OpenAI).  
* **Analytics Benefits**:  
  * The Agents SDK’s structured tracing (with spans for model calls, tools, and handoffs) provides more granular data for analytics compared to raw Responses API calls. For example, you can analyze the performance of individual agents, the frequency of handoffs, or the latency of specific tools. This makes the SDK particularly advantageous for complex applications.

**Recommendations and Summary**

* **For Part (a)**: Use the OpenAI Agents SDK with a custom TraceProcessor to save traces locally during app execution. Alternatively, integrate with Langfuse for structured trace capture and analytics. This approach is scalable and allows you to perform analytics on traces without relying on the OpenAI Dashboard.  
* **For Part (b)**: There is no public API for downloading traces from the OpenAI Dashboard as of June 1, 2025\. Focus on local trace capture (as in part a) or use a third-party observability platform like Langfuse to store and query traces via its API. Contact OpenAI support for potential enterprise solutions if needed.  
* **For Part (c)**: Using the OpenAI Agents SDK enhances tracing capabilities by providing built-in support for capturing detailed traces of agent workflows. It simplifies local trace capture and provides richer data for analytics, especially for multi-agent systems. However, it does not change the lack of a public API for accessing dashboard traces.

**Additional Notes**

* **Security Considerations**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or Azure Key Vault) and avoid embedding it in code. If saving traces locally, be cautious of sensitive data (e.g., user inputs, audio data) and configure RunConfig.trace\_include\_sensitive\_data or VoicePipelineConfig.trace\_include\_sensitive\_audio\_data to disable sensitive data capture if needed.  
* **Future Updates**: OpenAI may introduce an API for accessing dashboard traces in the future, as the Responses API is relatively new (released in early 2025). Check the OpenAI Platform documentation (platform.openai.com) or GitHub repository (openai.github.io) for updates.  
* **Analytics Tools**: For advanced analytics, consider using tools like Pandas, SQLite, or visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to process and visualize trace data. Langfuse also provides dashboards for visualizing metrics like latency and token usage.

If you need further assistance with implementing a specific trace processor, integrating with Langfuse, or setting up analytics pipelines, please provide more details about your app’s setup (e.g., programming language, analytics requirements), and I can provide more tailored guidance.

It's understandable that you want to gain better control over your tracing data, especially for analytical purposes, without relying heavily on third-party SaaS solutions. Let's break down your options focusing on OpenAI's built-in capabilities and open-source libraries like OpenTelemetry.

First, it's important to clarify some distinctions:

*   **OpenAI Dashboard Traces:** These are generated by OpenAI on their backend and are primarily for debugging and visualization within their dashboard. As of my last update, there isn't a direct API provided by OpenAI to programmatically download or export the raw trace data you see in the dashboard at a later time.
*   **Your Application's Local Traces/Logs:** This refers to the data you capture and store on your side, which is what you're aiming for.

Here are your options, focusing on built-in OpenAI capabilities and open-source methods:

---

### Option 1: Manual Local Logging of Requests and Responses (Fundamental Approach)

This is the most straightforward and reliable way to get a local copy of *everything* that happens between your application and the OpenAI API, regardless of whether you're using the AI Agent SDK or direct API calls. This approach gives you complete control over the data you capture and how it's stored.

**How to do it:**

1.  **Intercept Requests and Responses:** Before sending a request to OpenAI and immediately after receiving a response, capture the full payload of both.
2.  **Use a Standard Logging Library:** Employ your programming language's native or a widely adopted open-source logging library (e.g., Python's `logging` module, Node.js's `winston`, Java's `Logback`).
3.  **Structure Your Logs:** Store the captured data in a structured format like JSON. This makes it easy to parse and analyze later. Include key information such as:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Request payload (model, messages/prompt, temperature, etc.)
    *   Response payload (generated text, tool calls, finish reason)
    *   Usage statistics (tokens used, prompt tokens, completion tokens)
    *   Latency/duration of the API call
    *   Unique request ID (if available, for correlation)
    *   Any error messages

**Example (Python with `openai` library):**

```python
import openai
import json
import logging
from datetime import datetime

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename='openai_traces.log', format='%(message)s')

def call_openai_and_log(client, model, messages, **kwargs):
    trace_data = {
        "timestamp_start": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "request": {
            "model": model,
            "messages": messages,
            "kwargs": kwargs
        },
        "response": None,
        "error": None,
        "usage": None,
        "latency_ms": None,
        "timestamp_end": None
    }

    start_time = datetime.now()
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            **kwargs
        )
        end_time = datetime.now()
        latency = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds() * 1000

        trace_data["response"] = response.to_dict() # Convert Pydantic model to dictionary
        trace_data["usage"] = response.usage.to_dict()
        trace_data["latency_ms"] = latency
        trace_data["timestamp_end"] = end_time.isoformat()

    except openai.APIError as e:
        end_time = datetime.now()
        latency = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds() * 1000
        trace_data["error"] = {
            "type": e.type,
            "message": e.message,
            "code": e.code
        }
        trace_data["latency_ms"] = latency
        trace_data["timestamp_end"] = end_time.isoformat()
        logging.error(f"OpenAI API Error: {json.dumps(trace_data)}")
        raise # Re-raise the exception after logging
    except Exception as e:
        end_time = datetime.now()
        latency = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds() * 1000
        trace_data["error"] = {"message": str(e)}
        trace_data["latency_ms"] = latency
        trace_data["timestamp_end"] = end_time.isoformat()
        logging.error(f"Unexpected Error: {json.dumps(trace_data)}")
        raise # Re-raise the exception after logging

    logging.info(json.dumps(trace_data))
    return response

# Example usage:
# from openai import OpenAI
# client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
#
# try:
#     completion = call_openai_and_log(
#         client,
#         model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
#         messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
#     )
#     print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"Call failed: {e}")
```

### Option 2: Leveraging OpenAI AI Agent SDK with OpenTelemetry (Advanced Tracing)

The OpenAI AI Agent SDK has robust built-in tracing capabilities. By default, these traces are sent to the OpenAI dashboard. However, the SDK also allows for **custom trace processors**, which is where OpenTelemetry comes in.

This approach is more powerful than simple logging because OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to capture, process, and export distributed traces, metrics, and logs. It's designed for observability, allowing you to correlate events across different parts of your application and services.

**How it works:**

The AI Agent SDK generates traces and spans (units of work within a trace) that conform to the OpenTelemetry data model. You can configure a custom trace processor to *intercept* these traces and send them to an OpenTelemetry collector or directly to an OpenTelemetry exporter that writes to local files or another backend you control.

1.  **Install OpenTelemetry SDK:** You'll need the OpenTelemetry Python SDK and its relevant exporters.
    ```bash
    pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-api
    ```
    (You might also need `opentelemetry-sdk` for the base SDK and `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` for sending to an OTLP collector, or `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws` if you want to integrate with AWS X-Ray, etc.)

2.  **Configure OpenTelemetry Tracer Provider:** Set up a basic OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider` with an appropriate exporter (e.g., `ConsoleSpanExporter` for testing, or `FileSpanExporter` if available for direct file output, or `OTLPSpanExporter` to send to a local OTLP collector which then writes to disk).

3.  **Implement a Custom Trace Processor:** Create a class that implements the `TraceProcessor` interface from the OpenAI SDK. In its `process_trace` method, you'll receive the trace data generated by the OpenAI Agent. You then forward this data to your configured OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider`.

**Conceptual Example (Python):**

```python
import os
from openai.lib.streaming._trace import TraceProcessor
from openai.lib.streaming._trace import TraceEvent, TraceType
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor
# For more advanced local storage, you might use a file exporter
# from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
# from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# 1. Configure OpenTelemetry Tracer Provider
# For simplicity, let's just print spans to console.
# For local file storage, you would typically set up an OTLP exporter
# pointing to a local OpenTelemetry Collector that writes to a file or database.
provider = TracerProvider()
span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# You can get a tracer instance from the provider
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# 2. Implement a Custom Trace Processor for OpenAI Agent SDK
class OpenTelemetryTraceProcessor(TraceProcessor):
    def process_trace(self, trace_event: TraceEvent) -> None:
        # The OpenAI SDK's TraceEvent structure can be mapped to OpenTelemetry spans.
        # This mapping requires careful consideration of event types (TraceType).
        # For a full implementation, you'd create spans for each event,
        # set attributes, and ensure parent-child relationships are maintained.

        # This is a simplified example. A real implementation would:
        # 1. Start a root span for a TraceType.AGENT_RUN
        # 2. Create child spans for TraceType.LLM_RUN, TraceType.TOOL_CALL, etc.
        # 3. Add relevant attributes (model, input, output, errors, usage) to spans.
        # 4. End spans correctly.

        with tracer.start_as_current_span(f"{trace_event.event_type.value}") as span:
            span.set_attribute("openai.event_type", trace_event.event_type.value)
            span.set_attribute("openai.trace_id", trace_event.trace_id)
            span.set_attribute("openai.parent_id", trace_event.parent_id if trace_event.parent_id else "None")
            span.set_attribute("openai.data", str(trace_event.data)) # Convert data to string for logging

            # Example: For an LLM run, you might want to add more specific attributes
            if trace_event.event_type == TraceType.LLM_RUN and trace_event.data:
                span.set_attribute("openai.llm.model", trace_event.data.get("model"))
                span.set_attribute("openai.llm.input", str(trace_event.data.get("input")))
                span.set_attribute("openai.llm.output", str(trace_event.data.get("output")))
                span.set_attribute("openai.llm.usage", str(trace_event.data.get("usage")))
            # Similar logic for tool calls, agent steps, etc.

            if trace_event.event_type == TraceType.ERROR:
                span.record_exception(Exception(str(trace_event.data)))
                span.set_status(trace.Status(trace.StatusCode.ERROR))

        # You could also use a standard logging library here if you prefer simpler JSON logs
        # logging.info(json.dumps(trace_event.to_dict()))


# 3. Register your custom processor with the OpenAI SDK
from openai import OpenAI
from openai.lib.streaming._trace import set_trace_processors

# Ensure you have your OpenAI client initialized
# client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Set your custom processor. This will replace the default OpenAI dashboard processor.
# If you want to send to both OpenAI dashboard AND your custom processor,
# you might need to combine the default processor with yours, or ensure the SDK supports multiple.
# The documentation implies you set *the* trace processors, which could be a list.
set_trace_processors([OpenTelemetryTraceProcessor()])

# Now, when you run your OpenAI Agent application, the traces will be processed
# by your OpenTelemetryTraceProcessor and sent to the configured OpenTelemetry exporter.

# Example Agent run (assuming you have an agent defined)
# from openai.beta.agents import Agent
# my_agent = Agent(client=client, model="gpt-4o", tools=[], instructions="...")
# my_agent.run("What is the capital of France?")
```

**Key Considerations for OpenTelemetry:**

*   **OTLP Collector:** For robust local storage, you'd typically run a local OpenTelemetry Collector. Your Python application would send traces to this collector (e.g., via gRPC/HTTP OTLP exporter), and the collector would then be configured to export them to a file, a local database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL), or a time-series database. This setup separates the tracing logic from your application.
*   **Trace Context Propagation:** If your application is part of a larger microservices architecture, OpenTelemetry helps propagate trace context across service boundaries, allowing you to see end-to-end flows.
*   **Schema Mapping:** Carefully map the data provided by OpenAI's `TraceEvent` (which might contain details like `tool_calls`, `llm_generations`, `token_usage`) to OpenTelemetry span attributes.

---

### Option 3: Responses API (for Client-Side Data)

The "Responses API" generally refers to the structure of the data returned by OpenAI's models (e.g., `ChatCompletion`, `Completion` objects). It's not a separate API for *accessing historical traces* from OpenAI's side.

When you make a call using the `openai` Python library, the `response` object you receive already contains valuable "trace" information relevant to that specific call:

*   **`response.usage`**: Provides `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens`. This is crucial for cost and token usage analytics.
*   **`response.choices`**: Contains the generated content, `finish_reason`, and often `logprobs` or tool calls.
*   **`response.id`**: A unique ID for that specific API call.

You would integrate capturing this data into your **Option 1 (Manual Local Logging)** strategy. The `response.to_dict()` method (for Pydantic models in the Python SDK) is very useful for serializing these objects directly into your logs.

---

### Does it matter or change anything if my app is using the OpenAI AI Agent SDK?

**Yes, it matters significantly!**

*   **Built-in Tracing:** As discussed, the AI Agent SDK automatically generates detailed traces of agent execution, including LLM calls, tool invocations, and intermediate steps. This is far more granular than just logging API request/response pairs.
*   **Trace Processors:** The key difference is the ability to configure `set_trace_processors()`. This allows you to *intercept* the rich, structured trace data generated by the SDK and send it to your chosen local storage mechanism via OpenTelemetry or another custom handler. If you're not using the SDK, you don't get this automatic, detailed tracing; you're back to manual logging of individual API calls.
*   **Enrichment:** The SDK's traces are context-aware. They know if an LLM call was part of a tool invocation or a planning step, providing much richer data for analytics than just isolated API calls.

---

### Summary and Recommendation

1.  **For Comprehensive Local Data (including Agent Traces):**
    *   **If using OpenAI AI Agent SDK:** Combine **Option 2 (OpenTelemetry with custom trace processor)**. This is the most powerful and structured approach for detailed agent execution analytics. You'll get span-level data for every step of your agent's run.
    *   **Supplement with Manual Logging:** Even with OpenTelemetry, it's good practice to have a robust **Option 1 (Manual Local Logging)** around your core OpenAI API calls or `Agent.run()` calls. This ensures you capture any high-level errors or meta-information that might not be fully captured as detailed spans, or for simpler, file-based archival.

2.  **For Simple Local Data (without Agent SDK):**
    *   **Option 1 (Manual Local Logging)** is your primary method. Intercept and log all requests and responses directly.

3.  **Regarding OpenAI Dashboard Traces:**
    *   Do not rely on being able to download or access these programmatically from OpenAI. They are primarily for their internal debugging and your viewing. Your local logging strategies are the way to go for your analytics needs.

By implementing one or a combination of these methods, you'll gain full control over your OpenAI API interaction data for local analysis and auditing.
