Based on your research and needs, here's a comprehensive explanation of how to collect and manage traces from your AI Agent SDK Python project for analytics and evaluation purposes:

## Overview of Your Tracing Strategy

Since OpenAI doesn't provide a public API to download traces from their dashboard, you need to capture traces locally during execution. The OpenAI Agents SDK makes this straightforward with built-in tracing capabilities that you can customize.

## 1. Setting Up Local Trace Collection with OpenAI Agents SDK

The Agents SDK has tracing enabled by default and provides hooks to capture traces locally. Here's the recommended approach:

### Basic Setup with Custom Trace Processor

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, set_trace_processors, TraceProcessor
import json
from datetime import datetime
import os

class LocalFileTraceProcessor(TraceProcessor):
    def __init__(self, output_dir="traces"):
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
        
    def process_trace(self, trace):
        """Process and save each complete trace"""
        trace_data = {
            "trace_id": trace.trace_id,
            "workflow_name": trace.workflow_name,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "spans": []
        }
        
        # Extract all spans from the trace
        for span in trace.spans:
            span_data = {
                "span_id": span.span_id,
                "parent_id": span.parent_id,
                "operation": span.operation_name,
                "start_time": span.start_time,
                "end_time": span.end_time,
                "attributes": span.attributes,
                "events": []
            }
            
            # Capture events within spans (LLM calls, tool calls, etc.)
            for event in span.events:
                event_data = {
                    "name": event.name,
                    "timestamp": event.timestamp,
                    "attributes": event.attributes
                }
                
                # Extract key data for evals
                if event.name == "llm.generation":
                    event_data["input"] = event.attributes.get("input", "")
                    event_data["output"] = event.attributes.get("output", "")
                    event_data["model"] = event.attributes.get("model", "")
                    event_data["usage"] = event.attributes.get("usage", {})
                
                span_data["events"].append(event_data)
            
            trace_data["spans"].append(span_data)
        
        # Save to file
        filename = f"{self.output_dir}/trace_{trace.trace_id}_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(trace_data, f, indent=2, default=str)
    
    def process_span(self, span):
        """Process individual spans as they complete"""
        # You can optionally process spans in real-time
        pass

# Set up the custom processor
custom_processor = LocalFileTraceProcessor(output_dir="agent_traces")
set_trace_processors([custom_processor])

# Your agent code
agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model="gpt-4"
)

# Run the agent - traces will be automatically saved
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "What's the weather like today?")
```

### Enhanced Setup with OpenTelemetry Integration

For more sophisticated trace collection that integrates with standard observability tools:

```python
from agents import set_trace_processors, add_trace_processor
from agents.tracing.processors import OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
import json

# Configure OpenTelemetry
provider = TracerProvider()
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Export to local OTLP collector (which can write to files)
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
)
span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Add OTLP processor to agents SDK
add_trace_processor(
    OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor(endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces")
)

# Also add a custom processor for immediate local access
class EvalDataProcessor(TraceProcessor):
    def __init__(self, eval_file="eval_data.jsonl"):
        self.eval_file = eval_file
        
    def process_trace(self, trace):
        # Extract data specifically for evaluations
        for span in trace.spans:
            for event in span.events:
                if event.name == "llm.generation":
                    eval_entry = {
                        "trace_id": trace.trace_id,
                        "span_id": span.span_id,
                        "timestamp": event.timestamp,
                        "input": event.attributes.get("messages", []),
                        "output": event.attributes.get("output", ""),
                        "model": event.attributes.get("model", ""),
                        "temperature": event.attributes.get("temperature", 1.0),
                        "usage": event.attributes.get("usage", {}),
                        "ideal_answer": None  # Placeholder for manual annotation
                    }
                    
                    # Append to JSONL file for easy streaming
                    with open(self.eval_file, 'a') as f:
                        f.write(json.dumps(eval_entry) + '\n')

add_trace_processor(EvalDataProcessor())
```

## 2. Extracting Data for Evaluations

For your evaluation needs, you want to capture:
1. **Specific input** (complete context window)
2. **LLM output**
3. **Ideal answer** (to be added manually later)

Here's a focused approach:

```python
import pandas as pd
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class EvaluationDataCollector:
    def __init__(self, output_file="evaluation_dataset.csv"):
        self.output_file = output_file
        self.eval_data = []
        
    def extract_from_trace_files(self, trace_directory="agent_traces"):
        """Extract evaluation data from saved trace files"""
        import glob
        
        for trace_file in glob.glob(f"{trace_directory}/*.json"):
            with open(trace_file, 'r') as f:
                trace_data = json.load(f)
                
            # Extract LLM calls from trace
            for span in trace_data.get("spans", []):
                for event in span.get("events", []):
                    if event.get("name") == "llm.generation":
                        eval_entry = {
                            "trace_id": trace_data["trace_id"],
                            "workflow_name": trace_data.get("workflow_name", ""),
                            "timestamp": event["timestamp"],
                            "model": event["attributes"].get("model", ""),
                            "input_messages": json.dumps(event["attributes"].get("input", [])),
                            "output": event["attributes"].get("output", ""),
                            "prompt_tokens": event["attributes"].get("usage", {}).get("prompt_tokens", 0),
                            "completion_tokens": event["attributes"].get("usage", {}).get("completion_tokens", 0),
                            "total_tokens": event["attributes"].get("usage", {}).get("total_tokens", 0),
                            "ideal_answer": ""  # To be filled manually
                        }
                        self.eval_data.append(eval_entry)
        
        # Save to CSV for easy editing in spreadsheets
        df = pd.DataFrame(self.eval_data)
        df.to_csv(self.output_file, index=False)
        print(f"Saved {len(self.eval_data)} evaluation entries to {self.output_file}")
        
        return df

# Usage
collector = EvaluationDataCollector()
eval_df = collector.extract_from_trace_files()
```

## 3. Handling Multi-Step Workflows

For agent workflows with multiple interactions, you'll want to group related traces:

```python
class WorkflowTraceProcessor(TraceProcessor):
    def __init__(self, output_dir="workflow_traces"):
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
        self.active_workflows = {}
        
    def process_trace(self, trace):
        workflow_id = trace.workflow_name or trace.trace_id
        
        if workflow_id not in self.active_workflows:
            self.active_workflows[workflow_id] = {
                "workflow_id": workflow_id,
                "start_time": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "traces": [],
                "all_inputs": [],
                "all_outputs": []
            }
        
        workflow = self.active_workflows[workflow_id]
        
        # Extract all LLM interactions
        trace_summary = {
            "trace_id": trace.trace_id,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "llm_calls": []
        }
        
        for span in trace.spans:
            for event in span.events:
                if event.name == "llm.generation":
                    llm_call = {
                        "input": event.attributes.get("input", ""),
                        "output": event.attributes.get("output", ""),
                        "model": event.attributes.get("model", "")
                    }
                    trace_summary["llm_calls"].append(llm_call)
                    workflow["all_inputs"].append(llm_call["input"])
                    workflow["all_outputs"].append(llm_call["output"])
        
        workflow["traces"].append(trace_summary)
        
        # Check if workflow is complete (you'll need to define this logic)
        if self.is_workflow_complete(trace):
            self.save_workflow(workflow_id)
            del self.active_workflows[workflow_id]
    
    def is_workflow_complete(self, trace):
        # Implement logic to determine if a workflow is done
        # Could be based on specific events, timeouts, or explicit markers
        return trace.attributes.get("workflow_complete", False)
    
    def save_workflow(self, workflow_id):
        workflow = self.active_workflows[workflow_id]
        workflow["end_time"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
        
        filename = f"{self.output_dir}/workflow_{workflow_id}_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(workflow, f, indent=2, default=str)
```

## 4. Practical Implementation Tips

### Running a Local OpenTelemetry Collector

To use OpenTelemetry effectively, set up a local collector:

```yaml
# otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  file:
    path: ./traces.json
  logging:
    loglevel: debug

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [file, logging]
```

Run with Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 4318:4318 \
  -v $(pwd)/otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml \
  -v $(pwd)/traces:/traces \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest \
  --config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml
```

### Analytics-Ready Format

Convert traces to analytics-friendly formats:

```python
def traces_to_analytics_format(trace_dir="agent_traces"):
    """Convert trace files to a format suitable for analytics tools"""
    all_events = []
    
    for trace_file in glob.glob(f"{trace_dir}/*.json"):
        with open(trace_file, 'r') as f:
            trace = json.load(f)
            
        base_info = {
            "trace_id": trace["trace_id"],
            "workflow_name": trace.get("workflow_name", ""),
            "trace_timestamp": trace["timestamp"]
        }
        
        for span in trace.get("spans", []):
            for event in span.get("events", []):
                event_record = {**base_info}
                event_record.update({
                    "span_id": span["span_id"],
                    "operation": span["operation"],
                    "event_name": event["name"],
                    "event_timestamp": event["timestamp"]
                })
                
                # Flatten attributes
                for key, value in event.get("attributes", {}).items():
                    if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, bool)):
                        event_record[f"attr_{key}"] = value
                    else:
                        event_record[f"attr_{key}"] = json.dumps(value)
                
                all_events.append(event_record)
    
    # Save as CSV for easy import into analytics tools
    df = pd.DataFrame(all_events)
    df.to_csv("traces_analytics.csv", index=False)
    
    # Also save as Parquet for efficient querying
    df.to_parquet("traces_analytics.parquet", index=False)
    
    return df
```

## Summary

1. **Use the OpenAI Agents SDK's built-in tracing** with custom processors to capture traces locally
2. **Don't rely on downloading from OpenAI's dashboard** - there's no API for this
3. **Structure your trace data** for easy extraction of inputs, outputs, and metadata
4. **Use standard formats** (JSON, CSV, Parquet) for compatibility with analytics tools
5. **Consider OpenTelemetry** for more sophisticated trace management and integration with observability platforms

This approach gives you complete control over your trace data while maintaining compatibility with standard analytics workflows and evaluation frameworks.

# ChatGPT-o3 Response Follows

## End-to-End Plan for Capturing, Storing, and Re-using OpenAI Agent Traces

### 1.  Why you must export traces yourself

* The dashboard traces you see are created by an **internal ingest-only endpoint** (`POST /v1/traces/ingest`).
  No public “list” or bulk-export route exists today. ([OpenAI Community][1], [OpenAI GitHub][2])
* Therefore, the only dependable way to guarantee you have every prompt/response for later evals is to **capture a second copy at run-time**.

---

### 2.  Turn on full-fidelity tracing in the Agents SDK

Tracing is enabled automatically; each agent run emits spans for every LLM generation, tool call, guard-rail, hand-off, etc. ([GitHub][3])

```python
from agents import add_trace_processor, set_tracing_export_api_key
import os
set_tracing_export_api_key(os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])   # keeps the dashboard view
```

> **Include the raw prompt & completion**
> Spans already carry them. Keep `RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data=True` (default) so the context window and model output are preserved. ([OpenAI GitHub][4])

---

### 3.  Attach a second exporter for your own storage

Two lines give you a local copy without losing the dashboard conveniences.

```python
from agents.tracing.processors import OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor
add_trace_processor(
    OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor(
        endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"   # any OTLP-compatible collector
    )
)
```

* `OTLPHTTPTraceSpanProcessor` is documented in the SDK reference and can be aimed at **Jaeger, Tempo, Langfuse, Arize, Braintrust, Logfire, etc.** ([OpenAI GitHub][2], [Arize Docs][5])
* A vanilla **OpenTelemetry Collector** pointed at that endpoint can fan-out to S3/Parquet, Postgres, Elasticsearch or flat JSON files.

---

### 4.  File layout that works for spreadsheets & evals

| Folder       | Contents                                                                            | Notes                                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `raw/`       | One **JSONL file per day** – each line is the full OTLP span for a single LLM call. | Easy Pandas load; append-only.                                 |
| `runs/`      | `run-<trace_id>.json` – hierarchy of the whole workflow.                            | Lets you replay a multi-agent run end-to-end.                  |
| `eval_sets/` | CSV with three columns: `trace_id`, `actual_output`, `ideal_output`.                | You hand-author `ideal_output`; script can join on `trace_id`. |

A minimal ETL script that copies the prompt and completion into flat columns:

```python
import json, csv, glob
with open('eval_sets/today.csv','w', newline='') as f:
    w = csv.writer(f)
    w.writerow(['trace_id','input','model_output'])
    for fn in glob.glob('raw/2025-06-01*.jsonl'):
        for line in open(fn):
            span = json.loads(line)
            if span.get("attributes", {}).get("openai.event_type") == "LLM_RUN":
                w.writerow([
                    span["trace_id"],
                    span["attributes"]["openai.llm.input"],
                    span["attributes"]["openai.llm.output"]
                ])
```

You now have a spreadsheet-ready file to which you can append your “ideal answer” and run eval metrics.

---

### 5.  Handling long, multi-step workflows

* Every run already has a unique **`trace_id`**; keep that as the primary key across spans.
* To group separate agent steps that belong to the same logical “workflow”, wrap them in a `with trace("my_workflow_name"):` context; the SDK nests spans correctly. ([GitHub][3])
* Store the top-level “workflow” span JSON separately (`runs/` folder above) so you can reconstruct the full conversation.

---

### 6.  Quick evaluation loop

1. **Collect:** OTLP collector writes JSONL spans to S3 every hour.
2. **Materialise:** Daily job flattens LLM\_RUN spans to CSV.
3. **Annotate:** You (or an LLM‐assisted script) fill in the `ideal_output` column.
4. **Score:** Run BLEU, ROUGE or bespoke rubric graders; store results next to the CSV.
   Langfuse has a built-in `evaluate()` helper if you prefer hosted dashboards. ([Langfuse][6])

---

### 7.  If you are **not** on the Agents SDK

Wrap the ordinary OpenAI Python client with manual logging:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
log = {
    "trace_id": response.id,
    "input": messages,
    "output": response.choices[0].message.content,
    "usage": response.usage
}
jsonl_writer.write(log)
```

Automatic OpenInference instrumentation can turn those calls into OTLP spans identical to the agents pipeline. ([Arize Docs][5])

---

### 8.  Security & compliance switches

* `trace_include_sensitive_data=False` if you need to redact prompts/answers. ([OpenAI GitHub][4])
* `set_tracing_disabled(True)` removes the default exporter so **no data leaves your VPC**; keep only your custom processor. ([TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM][7])

---

### 9.  Checklist before production

* [ ] Collector is reachable (< 10 ms latency).
* [ ] Span count in your store == span count in dashboard.
* [ ] Daily back-ups verified.
* [ ] PII filter tested.
* [ ] Eval script passes on a test batch.

Once the above is in place you’ll have a reproducible, analytics-friendly record of **(1) full context window, (2) model output, (3) your gold-standard answer** for every call—ready for ad-hoc Pandas work, BI dashboards, or automated regression tests.

# Gemini 2.5 Pro Response Follows

Okay, this is a clear and well-defined need, and the research you've compiled provides excellent guidance. The core takeaway from your research is that **you cannot reliably download historical traces from the OpenAI dashboard via an API.** The solution lies in capturing the data *at runtime* from your application.

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is the absolute best tool for this, as it offers robust built-in tracing and, crucially, the ability to intercept and process those traces yourself. **OpenTelemetry** is the industry standard for collecting observable data (including traces), making it the ideal framework to integrate with the Agents SDK for local storage and analysis.

Here's a detailed, complete, and specific plan to achieve your needs, based on your research:

---

## Plan for Collecting & Analyzing Traces from Your OpenAI AI Agent SDK Project

### Core Principle: Real-time Capture, Not Dashboard Download

The traces you see in the OpenAI dashboard are primarily for debugging and visualization on their platform. As your research clearly states across all sources (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Grok3, Gemini), there is **no public API or bulk export functionality** to programmatically download these historical traces after they've been stored by OpenAI.

Therefore, the strategy is to **capture all necessary trace data directly from your application as it runs**, leveraging the powerful tracing capabilities of the OpenAI Agents SDK and exporting it to a local storage solution of your choice using OpenTelemetry.

---

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project with OpenAI Agents SDK and OpenTelemetry

This is the foundation for intercepting and storing your trace data.

#### 1.1. Install Necessary Libraries

You'll need the OpenAI Agents SDK, the core OpenTelemetry SDK, and an OpenTelemetry exporter to save your traces. For local files, you'd typically use an OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) exporter pointed at a local OpenTelemetry Collector, which then writes to a file or database. For simplicity, we'll demonstrate using a basic OTLP HTTP exporter.

```bash
pip install openai-agents opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
```

#### 1.2. Configure OpenTelemetry for Local Storage

OpenTelemetry works by routing "spans" (units of work within a trace) through a `TracerProvider` and then to an `Exporter`. For your use case, you want an exporter that saves data locally.

```python
import os
import json
from datetime import datetime

# OpenTelemetry imports
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.semconv.resource import ResourceAttributes

# We'll use a custom file exporter for simple local JSON saving.
# In a production setup, you'd send to a local OTel Collector or a database.
class CustomFileSpanExporter(ConsoleSpanExporter): # Inherit from ConsoleSpanExporter for structure, but override export
    def __init__(self, file_path="traces.jsonl"):
        self.file_path = file_path
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write("") # Clear file on init or ensure append mode

    def export(self, spans):
        # Convert OpenTelemetry spans to a dictionary format for JSON line output
        # This is a simplified conversion. A full OTel exporter would handle OTLP protobufs.
        # Here, we're just extracting key attributes for your specific needs.
        for span in spans:
            span_dict = {
                "trace_id": format(span.context.trace_id, '032x'),
                "span_id": format(span.context.span_id, '016x'),
                "parent_id": format(span.parent.span_id, '016x') if span.parent else None,
                "name": span.name,
                "start_time_unix_nano": span.start_time,
                "end_time_unix_nano": span.end_time,
                "attributes": dict(span.attributes), # Convert Attributes to dict
                "events": [{"name": event.name, "timestamp": event.timestamp, "attributes": dict(event.attributes)} for event in span.events],
                "status": {"status_code": span.status.status_code.name, "description": span.status.description},
                "resource_attributes": dict(span.resource.attributes)
            }

            with open(self.file_path, 'a') as f:
                f.write(json.dumps(span_dict) + "\n")
        return trace.export.SpanExportResult.SUCCESS


# Configure the TracerProvider
resource = Resource.create({
    ResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME: "my-ai-agent-app",
    ResourceAttributes.SERVICE_VERSION: "1.0.0",
})
provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
file_exporter = CustomFileSpanExporter()
span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(file_exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Get a tracer instance (though Agents SDK handles much of this automatically)
otel_tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

```

#### 1.3. Implement a Custom Trace Processor for OpenAI Agents SDK

This is the **critical step** that allows you to intercept the detailed trace data generated by the Agents SDK. The SDK provides `TraceProcessor` and `add_trace_processor()`.

```python
from agents import set_trace_processors, set_tracing_export_api_key
from openai.lib.streaming._trace import TraceProcessor, TraceEvent, TraceType
import logging

# Set up basic logging to see process
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class OpenAIAgentOTELProcessor(TraceProcessor):
    """
    A custom trace processor for OpenAI Agents SDK that converts SDK trace events
    into OpenTelemetry spans and then exports them via the configured OTel provider.
    """
    def __init__(self, otel_tracer_instance):
        self.otel_tracer = otel_tracer_instance
        self.span_map = {} # To keep track of active OTel spans by OpenAI trace/span ID

    def process_trace(self, trace_event: TraceEvent) -> None:
        # Each TraceEvent from the OpenAI Agents SDK corresponds to a unit of work.
        # We map these to OpenTelemetry spans.

        otel_span_name = f"openai_agent.{trace_event.event_type.value.lower()}"
        
        # Determine parent span for OpenTelemetry hierarchy
        parent_span_context = None
        if trace_event.parent_id and trace_event.parent_id in self.span_map:
            parent_span_context = self.span_map[trace_event.parent_id].context
        elif trace_event.trace_id != trace_event.parent_id and trace_event.trace_id in self.span_map:
            # Handle cases where parent_id is for the root trace itself but not the immediate parent span
            parent_span_context = self.span_map[trace_event.trace_id].context

        with self.otel_tracer.start_as_current_span(
            otel_span_name,
            context=parent_span_context,
            kind=trace.SpanKind.INTERNAL # Most agent steps are internal
        ) as otel_span:
            # Store the OTel span for child events to reference
            self.span_map[trace_event.id] = otel_span

            # Set core attributes for the span
            otel_span.set_attribute("openai.sdk.trace_id", trace_event.trace_id)
            otel_span.set_attribute("openai.sdk.span_id", trace_event.id)
            if trace_event.parent_id:
                otel_span.set_attribute("openai.sdk.parent_id", trace_event.parent_id)
            otel_span.set_attribute("openai.sdk.event_type", trace_event.event_type.value)
            otel_span.set_attribute("openai.sdk.start_time", trace_event.start_time.isoformat())

            # Add detailed data based on event type
            if trace_event.data:
                # Convert Pydantic models in data to dicts for JSON serialization
                processed_data = {}
                for key, value in trace_event.data.items():
                    try:
                        processed_data[key] = value.model_dump() if hasattr(value, 'model_dump') else value
                    except Exception:
                        processed_data[key] = str(value) # Fallback to string if cannot dump

                otel_span.set_attribute("openai.sdk.data", json.dumps(processed_data))

                # --- CRUCIAL FOR YOUR EVALS: Extracting Input and LLM Output ---
                if trace_event.event_type == TraceType.LLM_RUN:
                    # Input (everything that went into the context window)
                    if 'input' in processed_data:
                        # For chat models, 'input' is typically a list of message dicts
                        otel_span.set_attribute("llm.input.messages_json", json.dumps(processed_data['input']))
                    # LLM Output
                    if 'output' in processed_data and 'content' in processed_data['output']:
                        otel_span.set_attribute("llm.output.content", processed_data['output']['content'])
                    if 'usage' in processed_data:
                        otel_span.set_attribute("llm.usage.prompt_tokens", processed_data['usage'].get('prompt_tokens'))
                        otel_span.set_attribute("llm.usage.completion_tokens", processed_data['usage'].get('completion_tokens'))
                        otel_span.set_attribute("llm.usage.total_tokens", processed_data['usage'].get('total_tokens'))
                    if 'model' in processed_data:
                        otel_span.set_attribute("llm.model", processed_data['model'])

                elif trace_event.event_type == TraceType.TOOL_CALL:
                    if 'tool_name' in processed_data:
                        otel_span.set_attribute("tool.name", processed_data['tool_name'])
                    if 'tool_args' in processed_data:
                        otel_span.set_attribute("tool.args_json", json.dumps(processed_data['tool_args']))

                elif trace_event.event_type == TraceType.TOOL_OUTPUT:
                    if 'output' in processed_data:
                        otel_span.set_attribute("tool.output", str(processed_data['output'])) # Tool output can be complex

                elif trace_event.event_type == TraceType.ERROR:
                    otel_span.set_status(trace.Status(trace.StatusCode.ERROR, description=str(trace_event.data)))
                    otel_span.record_exception(Exception(str(trace_event.data)))

            # Mark the end of the span if it's a terminal event for that trace_id/span_id
            # The SDK handles span closure implicitly, but this is for conceptual mapping.
            if trace_event.event_type in [TraceType.AGENT_END, TraceType.LLM_END, TraceType.TOOL_END, TraceType.ERROR]:
                 if trace_event.id in self.span_map:
                     self.span_map[trace_event.id].end()
                     del self.span_map[trace_event.id]
                 if trace_event.trace_id == trace_event.id and trace_event.trace_id in self.span_map:
                     # If it's the root trace ending, ensure its span ends
                     self.span_map[trace_event.trace_id].end()
                     del self.span_map[trace_event.trace_id]

# Instantiate and register your custom processor
agent_otel_processor = OpenAIAgentOTELProcessor(otel_tracer)

# IMPORTANT: This replaces OpenAI's default processors.
# If you still want traces in the OpenAI dashboard, you would need to also
# include OpenAI's default exporter in the list if the SDK supported multi-exporters.
# As per research, `set_trace_processors` replaces.
# If you want both, consider sending OTel traces to a collector that then forwards to OpenAI (if that's an option via OTel, which it often is).
# For now, this is for local capture ONLY.
set_trace_processors([agent_otel_processor])

# If you still want to send some basic usage data to OpenAI for cost tracking (optional),
# you might still need this line, but it won't be sending full traces to their dashboard
# if set_trace_processors replaced the default one.
# set_tracing_export_api_key(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

#### 1.4. Run Your OpenAI Agent Application

Now, when you run your agent, the `OpenAIAgentOTELProcessor` will intercept all trace events, convert them into OpenTelemetry spans, and your `CustomFileSpanExporter` will write them to `traces.jsonl`.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace, set_trace_processors
# Make sure to run the OTel and TraceProcessor setup code above first!

# Example Agent Definition and Run
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Define a tool for the agent
def get_current_weather(location: str):
    """Get the current weather in a given location."""
    if "san francisco" in location.lower():
        return {"temperature": "72F", "conditions": "Sunny"}
    elif "london" in location.lower():
        return {"temperature": "55F", "conditions": "Cloudy"}
    else:
        return {"temperature": "N/A", "conditions": "Unknown"}

# Create an agent
weather_agent = Agent(
    client=client,
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="You are a helpful weather assistant. Use the available tools.",
    tools=[get_current_weather]
)

# Run the agent within a custom trace context for better identification
# The `with trace("your_workflow_name")` block helps categorize the top-level
# interaction in your traces.
with trace("WeatherQueryWorkflow"):
    print("Running Agent 1: What is the weather in San Francisco?")
    result1 = Runner.run_sync(weather_agent, "What is the weather in San Francisco?")
    print(f"Agent 1 Output: {result1.final_output}\n")

with trace("GeneralKnowledgeWorkflow"):
    print("Running Agent 2: What is the capital of France?")
    result2 = Runner.run_sync(weather_agent, "What is the capital of France?")
    print(f"Agent 2 Output: {result2.final_output}\n")

# You might want to explicitly flush the exporter's buffer at the end of your script
# if using a BatchSpanProcessor or similar. SimpleSpanProcessor flushes immediately.
print(f"Traces saved to traces.jsonl")

```

### Step 2: Extracting Data for Evals and Analysis

The `traces.jsonl` file will now contain one JSON object per line, each representing an OpenTelemetry span. These spans are highly structured and contain the exact data you need.

#### 2.1. Locating Input (Context Window) and LLM Output

In the `traces.jsonl` file, you will be looking for spans where:
*   `"name"` starts with `"openai_agent.llm_run"` (indicating an LLM call).
*   Inside the `"attributes"` dictionary:
    *   **Input (Context Window):** Look for the `llm.input.messages_json` attribute. This will be a JSON string of the `messages` list (including system, user, assistant, and tool messages) that were sent to the LLM.
    *   **LLM Output:** Look for the `llm.output.content` attribute. This will be the LLM's generated response string.
    *   You'll also find `llm.model` for the model used, and `llm.usage.prompt_tokens`, `llm.usage.completion_tokens` for token counts.

#### 2.2. Handling Workflows / Longer Spans of Interactions

The hierarchical nature of OpenTelemetry traces, directly mapped from the Agents SDK, natively supports this:
*   **`trace_id`**: This identifies the entire workflow or a longer span of interaction. All spans belonging to a single top-level `with trace("WorkflowName")` block will share the same `trace_id`.
*   **`span_id`**: Identifies a specific operation within that workflow (e.g., an LLM call, a tool call, an agent step).
*   **`parent_id`**: Links a span to its parent span, creating a nested hierarchy that shows the flow of execution within your agent.
*   **`openai.sdk.event_type`**: Helps you understand what kind of event each span represents (e.g., `AGENT_RUN`, `LLM_RUN`, `TOOL_CALL`, `TOOL_OUTPUT`).

You can group all spans by their `trace_id` to reconstruct a complete workflow. The `parent_id` attribute allows you to understand the sequence and nesting of operations within that workflow.

#### 2.3. Integrating Your Ideal Answer for Evals

This is external data that you'll craft. To link it to your collected traces:
1.  **For Workflow-level Evals:** Use the root `trace_id` of a complete interaction workflow as the primary key. When you craft an ideal answer for a multi-turn conversation or complex agent task, associate it with that `trace_id`.
2.  **For Individual LLM Call Evals:** If you want to evaluate specific LLM responses within a larger workflow, you can use a combination of the `trace_id` and the `span_id` of the `llm_run` span.
3.  **Data Structure:** Store your ideal answers in a separate spreadsheet or database table that has columns for `trace_id` (and optionally `span_id`) to enable easy joining with your collected trace data.

#### 2.4. Making Data Usable for Spreadsheets & Analytics Tools

The `traces.jsonl` file contains JSON objects.

*   **For Spreadsheets:**
    *   You'll need a script (e.g., using Python's `pandas` library) to load `traces.jsonl`, flatten the nested JSON (especially the `attributes` and `data` fields), and then export it to CSV.
    *   Focus on extracting key attributes like `trace_id`, `span_id`, `name`, `llm.input.messages_json`, `llm.output.content`, `llm.model`, `llm.usage.total_tokens`, etc., into separate columns.
    *   Example using `pandas` to flatten the data for a CSV:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import json

    data = []
    with open('traces.jsonl', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            data.append(json.loads(line))

    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Flatten the 'attributes' column for easier access
    # This is a simplified flattening. For deep nesting, you might need recursive flattening.
    df_attributes = pd.json_normalize(df['attributes'].apply(lambda x: x if x is not None else {}))
    df_merged = pd.concat([df.drop(columns=['attributes', 'events', 'status', 'resource_attributes']), df_attributes], axis=1)

    # Convert specific JSON string columns back to parsed JSON objects if needed for deeper analysis
    # For spreadsheets, you might keep them as strings or further flatten specific parts.
    # Example: Parse 'llm.input.messages_json' into a structured object for Python analysis
    # df_merged['llm.input.messages'] = df_merged['llm.input.messages_json'].apply(lambda x: json.loads(x) if pd.notna(x) else None)

    # Select relevant columns for your eval spreadsheet
    eval_df = df_merged[[
        'trace_id',
        'span_id',
        'name', # e.g., openai_agent.llm_run, openai_agent.tool_call
        'openai.sdk.event_type',
        'llm.model',
        'llm.input.messages_json', # The full input context
        'llm.output.content',      # The LLM's raw output
        'llm.usage.prompt_tokens',
        'llm.usage.completion_tokens',
        'llm.usage.total_tokens',
        # Add other relevant attributes like tool.name, tool.args_json, etc.
    ]].copy()

    # Filter for LLM run traces specifically for evals
    llm_eval_df = eval_df[eval_df['openai.sdk.event_type'] == 'LLM_RUN'].copy()

    # You might want to assign a unique ID that combines trace_id and span_id for linking
    llm_eval_df['eval_id'] = llm_eval_df['trace_id'] + '_' + llm_eval_df['span_id']

    # Export to CSV
    llm_eval_df.to_csv('llm_eval_data.csv', index=False)
    print("LLM evaluation data saved to llm_eval_data.csv")

    # For broader analysis of workflows, you can save the full merged DataFrame
    # df_merged.to_csv('all_traces_flattened.csv', index=False)
    # print("All flattened trace data saved to all_traces_flattened.csv")
    ```

*   **For Various Analytics Tools:** Most modern analytics tools (e.g., BI tools, data science notebooks, custom scripts) can easily import JSON Line (`.jsonl`) files. You can then use their respective data processing capabilities to flatten and query the data.
*   **Database Storage:** For larger volumes or more complex querying, consider exporting traces from your OpenTelemetry Collector directly into a local PostgreSQL, SQLite, or specialized tracing database (like Jaeger or Tempo if you run them locally). This would provide SQL-like access for analysis.

### Does it matter or change anything if my app is using the OpenAI AI Agent SDK?

**Yes, it matters immensely and is the cornerstone of this solution.**

1.  **Built-in Structured Tracing:** The Agents SDK automatically generates rich, structured trace data (`TraceEvent` objects) for every step of your agent's execution: LLM calls, tool invocations, tool outputs, handoffs, guardrail checks, etc. This is far more granular and contextual than just logging raw OpenAI API requests/responses.
2.  **Custom Trace Processor Support:** This is the *key feature* that enables your solution. The `set_trace_processors()` function allows you to hook into this built-in tracing stream and direct the data to your own storage (like OpenTelemetry + local files/database) instead of solely relying on OpenAI's dashboard. Without the SDK, you'd have to manually instrument every LLM call and tool interaction to collect this level of detail.
3.  **Workflow Context:** The SDK naturally groups related operations into `trace_id`s and `span_id`s, making it easy to reconstruct full agent workflows and long interaction sequences. This is crucial for evaluating multi-turn agents or complex chained tasks.
4.  **Richer Data for Evals:** The SDK's traces provide specific attributes like `llm.input.messages_json` (the full context window), `llm.output.content`, and detailed tool information, which are exactly what you need for comprehensive evaluations.

**In summary:** If you were just using the standard OpenAI Responses API directly, you would have to manually implement extensive logging around every `client.chat.completions.create()` call, extract inputs/outputs, and manage trace IDs yourself. The Agents SDK automates much of this, making it much easier and more robust to collect the detailed trace data you require for analysis and evaluations.

---

By following this plan, you will gain full control over your agent's interaction data, enabling detailed analysis in spreadsheets and analytics tools, and providing the precise input, output, and workflow context needed for your evaluation pipeline.

# Perplexity Labs Response Follows

## Complete Plan for Collecting OpenAI Agents SDK Traces for EvaluationsBased on your research, the optimal solution for collecting evaluation data from your OpenAI Agents SDK Python project is implementing a **custom TracingProcessor** that automatically captures exactly what you need for evaluations [2][3][4].

## Why This Approach is SuperiorYour research revealed several approaches for collecting agent traces, but the custom TracingProcessor method stands out as the clear winner for evaluation purposes [2][5][6].The custom TracingProcessor approach provides complete data control, automatic CSV export, and captures 100% of your interactions without relying on external services or manual processes [2][5]. Unlike the OpenAI Dashboard which doesn't offer programmatic data export, or third-party tools that require additional costs and setup, this solution gives you immediate local access to all trace data [3][6].

## What Data Gets Captured for EvaluationsThe implementation automatically captures exactly the three components you need for evaluations [2][4]:

### 1. Complete Input Context (Everything in the Context Window)
- Agent instructions and system prompts
- User input and conversation history  
- Available tools and their schemas
- Model configuration parameters
- **Full context window content** - the complete prompt sent to the LLM [2][4]

### 2. Complete LLM Output Data
- Raw LLM response text
- Tool calls made during execution
- Finish reason and completion status
- Performance metrics (latency, tokens used, estimated costs) [2][4]

### 3. Evaluation Framework
- Empty `ideal_answer` field for your hand-crafted responses
- Evaluation scoring fields
- Notes and categorization columns [4][5]## Implementation GuideThe implementation leverages the OpenAI Agents SDK's built-in tracing capabilities through custom processors [2][3][6]. Tracing is enabled by default in the SDK and captures comprehensive events including LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, and guardrails [2][3].

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

openai-agents>=0.1.0
pandas>=1.5.0
python-dateutil>=2.8.0


### Step 2: Add Trace Collection to Your ProjectThe beauty of this approach is that it requires minimal changes to your existing code [2][4]. Simply add the evaluation collection setup to your main application:



# example_integration.py
# Shows exactly how to add evaluation trace collection to your existing AI Agents SDK project

import asyncio
import os
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool
from evaluation_trace_collector import setup_evaluation_collection

# Set up your OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# 1. SET UP EVALUATION COLLECTION (add this line to your main app)
collector = setup_evaluation_collection()

# 2. YOUR EXISTING AGENT CODE (no changes needed!)
@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather information for a city"""
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny and 72°F"

@function_tool  
def get_order_status(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Get the status of an order"""
    return f"Order {order_id} is shipped and will arrive tomorrow"

# Create your agent exactly as before
customer_service_agent = Agent(
    name="Customer Service Assistant",
    instructions="""You are a helpful customer service representative.
    Answer questions politely and use tools when needed to get accurate information.
    Always explain what you're doing when using tools.""",
    tools=[get_weather, get_order_status],
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

async def main():
    """Your main application logic - unchanged!"""

    # Test cases for evaluation
    test_cases = [
        "What's the weather like in San Francisco?",
        "Can you check the status of order #12345?", 
        "I need help with my account",
        "What is your return policy?",
        "How do I cancel my subscription?"
    ]

    print("Running agent with evaluation data collection...")

    # Run your agents exactly as before - traces are automatically collected
    for i, user_input in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
        print(f"\n=== Test Case {i} ===")
        print(f"User: {user_input}")

        # Use trace context to group multi-step workflows
        from agents import trace
        with trace(f"Customer_Support_Case_{i}"):

            # Your normal agent execution - no changes!
            result = await Runner.run(customer_service_agent, user_input)

            print(f"Agent: {result.final_output}")

    # 3. EXPORT YOUR EVALUATION DATA
    print("\n=== Exporting Evaluation Data ===")
    master_file = collector.export_all_data()
    print(f"📊 All evaluation data saved to: {master_file}")

    # 4. ADD IDEAL ANSWERS (do this once after collecting data)
    from evaluation_trace_collector import add_ideal_answers_to_csv

    ideal_answers = {
        "What's the weather like in San Francisco?": 
            "I'll check the current weather in San Francisco for you. [Uses weather tool] The weather in San Francisco is sunny and 72°F.",

        "Can you check the status of order #12345?": 
            "I'll look up the status of order #12345 for you. [Uses order status tool] Order #12345 is shipped and will arrive tomorrow.",

        "I need help with my account": 
            "I'd be happy to help you with your account. Could you please provide more details about what specific assistance you need?",

        "What is your return policy?": 
            "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase. Items must be in original condition with receipt. Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days.",

        "How do I cancel my subscription?": 
            "I can help you cancel your subscription. To ensure security, I'll need to verify your account first. Please provide your email address or account number."
    }

    updated_file = add_ideal_answers_to_csv(master_file, ideal_answers)
    print(f"📋 Updated CSV with ideal answers: {updated_file}")

    # Clean shutdown
    collector.shutdown()

    print("\n✅ Complete! Your evaluation data is ready for analysis.")
    print("\nNext steps:")
    print(f"1. Open {updated_file} in Excel/Google Sheets")
    print("2. Compare 'llm_output' vs 'ideal_answer' columns")
    print("3. Add evaluation scores and notes")
    print("4. Use data for training/fine-tuning improvements")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())


### Step 3: Automatic Data ExportThe system automatically exports evaluation data in CSV format after each trace completes [4][5]. You get both individual trace files and a master file containing all collected data, perfect for spreadsheet analysis [4].

## Multi-Step Workflow SupportYour research emphasized the need to handle complex agent workflows with multiple LLM interactions [2][4]. The implementation addresses this through several mechanisms:

- **Workflow Step Tracking**: Each LLM call gets a sequential step number within the workflow
- **Trace Grouping**: All steps from the same workflow share a common `trace_id` 
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Spans maintain hierarchical relationships for complex flows
- **Multi-Step Indicators**: Boolean flags identify workflows with multiple LLM interactions [4][5]

For multi-step workflows, each LLM generation becomes a separate row in your CSV, but they're grouped by `trace_id` so you can analyze the complete workflow sequence [4][5].

## CSV Output Structure for AnalysisThe exported CSV contains columns specifically designed for evaluation workflows [4][5]:

| Column | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `user_input` | Original user question | Input for evaluation |
| `full_context` | Complete LLM context window | Full input analysis |
| `llm_output` | Agent's response | Actual output to evaluate |
| `ideal_answer` | Your hand-crafted response | Gold standard comparison |
| `evaluation_score` | Numeric evaluation rating | Scoring field |
| `workflow_step_number` | Step in multi-step flow | Workflow analysis |
| `trace_id` | Groups related interactions | Workflow grouping |

## Adding Your Ideal Answers

After collecting trace data, you can programmatically add your hand-crafted ideal answers to the CSV files [4][5]. The implementation includes helper functions to map user inputs to ideal responses, creating the complete evaluation dataset you need.

## Integration with Evaluation ToolsThe CSV format works seamlessly with various analysis approaches [4]:

- **Spreadsheet Analysis**: Direct import into Excel, Google Sheets, or similar tools
- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**: Structured format for automated evaluation scripts  
- **Custom Analytics**: Compatible with pandas, SQL databases, and data visualization tools
- **OpenAI Evaluation Suite**: Ready for integration with OpenAI's evaluation frameworks

## Technical Implementation DetailsThe core implementation uses a custom `TracingProcessor` class that intercepts trace events from the OpenAI Agents SDK [2][5][6]. The processor specifically targets `GenerationSpanData` events, which contain the LLM input/output pairs you need for evaluations [2][5].

## Complete Guide: Collecting OpenAI Agents SDK Traces for Evaluations

Based on your research, here's a complete, actionable plan to collect traces from your OpenAI Agents SDK Python project for evaluation purposes.

### Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

```python
# 1. Install required packages
pip install openai-agents pandas

# 2. Set up your trace collector (add this to your main app)
from evaluation_trace_collector import setup_evaluation_collection

# Initialize evaluation data collection
collector = setup_evaluation_collection()

# 3. Run your agents normally - traces are automatically collected!
# Your existing agent code doesn't need to change
```

### What You Get Automatically

The implementation captures **exactly what you need for evaluations**:

#### 1. Complete Input Context (Everything that went to the LLM)
- Agent instructions
- User input  
- Conversation history
- Available tools
- Model name
- **Full context window content** (complete prompt sent to LLM)

#### 2. Complete Output Data
- LLM response text
- Tool calls made
- Finish reason
- Performance metrics (latency, tokens, cost)

#### 3. Evaluation-Ready CSV Format
Each row contains one LLM interaction with columns for:
- `user_input` - What the user asked
- `full_context` - Complete context sent to LLM  
- `llm_output` - What the LLM responded
- `ideal_answer` - **Empty field for your hand-crafted ideal responses**
- Plus metadata (trace_id, timestamps, performance metrics)

### Multi-Step Workflow Support

For agents with multiple LLM calls in one workflow:
- Each LLM call gets its own row
- `workflow_step_number` tracks the sequence
- `trace_id` groups all steps from same workflow
- `is_multi_step_workflow` flag identifies complex flows

### How to Use This for Evaluations

#### Step 1: Collect Your Data
```python
# Your existing agent code with trace collection added
collector = setup_evaluation_collection()

# Run your agents normally
result = await Runner.run(agent, "User question here")

# Data is automatically saved to CSV files in eval_data/ folder
```

#### Step 2: Add Your Ideal Answers
```python
# Define what the perfect response should be
ideal_answers = {
    "What is your return policy?": "Our return policy allows...",
    "How do I track my order?": "You can track your order by...",
    # Add more ideal responses
}

# Add them to your CSV
updated_csv = add_ideal_answers_to_csv("eval_data/your_file.csv", ideal_answers)
```

#### Step 3: Analyze in Spreadsheets/Tools
Open the CSV in Excel, Google Sheets, or your analytics tool. You have:
- Column A: User input
- Column B: Full LLM context  
- Column C: Actual LLM output
- Column D: Your ideal answer
- Columns E+: Metadata, performance metrics

Perfect for:
- Manual evaluation scoring
- LLM-as-judge evaluation
- Performance analysis
- Error pattern identification

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom Evaluation Metrics
```python
# Extend the EvaluationRecord dataclass to add your own fields
@dataclass 
class MyEvaluationRecord(EvaluationRecord):
    custom_score: float = 0.0
    category: str = ""
    complexity_level: int = 1
```

#### Integration with Evaluation Tools
The CSV format works directly with:
- OpenAI's evaluation tools
- LangSmith evaluation
- Custom evaluation scripts
- Any spreadsheet software

#### Export Options
```python
# Export all data at once
master_file = collector.export_all_data()

# Or export per trace automatically
# (happens automatically when each trace completes)
```

### File Structure You'll Get

```
eval_data/
├── eval_data_20250601_143022_1a2b3c4d.csv    # Individual trace files
├── eval_data_20250601_143022_1a2b3c4d.json   # Detailed JSON version
├── eval_data_20250601_143055_5e6f7g8h.csv    # Another trace
└── all_eval_data_20250601_150000.csv         # Master file with everything
```

### Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Zero Code Changes**: Your existing agent code doesn't need modification
2. **Complete Context**: Captures everything that went into the LLM context window
3. **Evaluation Ready**: Perfect format for manual or automated evaluation
4. **Workflow Aware**: Handles complex multi-step agent workflows
5. **Analytics Friendly**: CSV format works with any analysis tool
6. **Performance Tracking**: Built-in latency, token, and cost tracking

### Different from OpenAI Dashboard

- **Dashboard**: Good for debugging, can't export data programmatically
- **This Solution**: Gives you complete local control over your evaluation data
- **Coverage**: Captures 100% of your interactions vs. relying on dashboard access

This implementation is based on the latest OpenAI Agents SDK tracing capabilities and gives you exactly what you need for comprehensive evaluation workflows.
